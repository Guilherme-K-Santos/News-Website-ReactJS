## Overview

- Well, it was a bit difficult for me, especially in css, but it was helpful to know which technology I should study next.

## How it works?

- My public is a normal one with a different style font imported.

- My src, as a react application, has two different things, one of them is the components folder - which created everything on the site
with jsx, props and state. Also, the css folder that grinds which component (files with sibling names). 

- Together with the css files has two files that regule the mobile style.

- My apologies about the css and mobile css files, it is really repetitive and a little mess.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS Flexbox
- Javascript
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library

### What I learned

- That was a great challange to training my react skills, creating components and some other basics like state and props;
- After completing this i realized, i need to learn somes librarys of css (preprocessors or bootstrap), because i know, 
my css is a lot of repetitive and not elegant.

### Continued development

- In future project i'm will continue learning about react, javascript, css librarys/preprocessors and backend (nodeJS).
